# Test The Library!

The index.js contains a functional library without any tests! 

Your objective: 

- Write at least 1 test per function in the library
- Try to test as many use cases as possible
- Try to use different approaches when writing out your tests

Please don't hesitate to check out any of the examples for help, and remember google is your friend! (check out the tape npmjs page!)
