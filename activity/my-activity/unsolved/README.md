# Test The Library!

The index.js contains a functional library without any tests!

Your objective:

- Write at least 1 test per function in the library
- Try to test as many use cases as possible
- Try to use different approaches when writing out your tests

Please don't hesitate to check out any of the examples for help, and remember google is your friend! (check out the tape npmjs page!)

## How To

- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the repo folder and run `npm i`
- Use the command `npm run test:activity`
- See your console light up with your tests!

## Info

This activity uses the formatter known as `tap-spec` which formats it a little differently to your console. You can check out module on its npm here:

**[tap-spec npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap-spec)**

Remember the goal is to at least run 1 test per function, no matter how you do it. The optimal challenge is to try to test all of the use cases you can think of for each function.

**Good luck!**
