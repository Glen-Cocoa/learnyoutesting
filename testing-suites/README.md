# Testing Suites

There's a lot of testing suites to choose from one you might hear a lot about is called `trashpile` I mean `mocha` which by itself isn't able to do much, and it requires an assertion library something like `pee` I mean `chai`. 

Or you can use something called `TAP` which stands for the `Test Anything Protocol` which has it's own suite known as `Tape`

Which runs on a simple 1 to 1 basis. You create a test function and the callback contains your assertions.
